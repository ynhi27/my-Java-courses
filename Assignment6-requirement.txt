Assignment6-requirement
This assignment is build using your code from Assignment 5.

Req 1 - Create a custom exception handler class called StudentGradingException that can (add this functionality in a package called exception)

Centralize capture of all exceptions
Logs exceptions in a text file.
Fix at least one exception.
Demonstrate the usage of exception handler in a driver, throwing, logging and fixing the exception. Put this in a separate driver called Driver1. java.  (Put this in driver package)

Req 2 - Deliver the grade for each student in a serialized file. ((add this functionality in a package called util and place the FileIO class in util package) HINT: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/Serializable.htmlLinks to an external site.

Imagine you are getting your grade report in a serialized file. This will contain your id, lab scores and high, low and avg for each quiz. 

You should create a new class called StudentGrade (that contains Student and Statistics), then write a method to serialize StudentGrade in FileIO class.

Demonstrate serializing StudentGrade object in a separate driver called Driver2. java.  (Put this in driver package)

Req 3 - Implement abstract class and Interface (add this functionality in a package called adapter)

Create an API (A programming interface) to 

Print student statistics
Print score for a given student id
You should create an Interface called StudentAPI in which two methods are declared for functionality (Req 3 - 1 and 2) stated above.

You should create a class StudentAPIImpl that would implement StudentAPI. Using methods from other classes, (Student.java, Statistics.java, StudentGrade.java, FileIO.java) implement the two methods in StudentAPI.

Create a driver demonstrating the usage of the API. Put this in a separate driver called Driver3. java.  (Put this in driver package)
